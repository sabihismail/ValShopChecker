# Valorant Shop Checker

### Local script to check multiple accounts shops and stuff
### Most of the code (riot auth) came from https://github.com/GamerNoTitle/Valora so shout out that guy

### Usage: 
- Modify `config.yaml` to look something like:

```text
accounts:
  - user: test
    pw: pass
  - user: account2
    pw: pass3
```

- Run the following:

```shell
python ./main.py
```
